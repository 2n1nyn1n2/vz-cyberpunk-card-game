### Logistics for Overcoming Challenges
To integrate these into the game loop:
-
**Resource Tracking:** Players start with a backpack holding 3-5 possessions (e.g.,
choose 3 from: pickaxe, red jasper, flashlight, foreman, etc.). Resources like money ($20
start), rocks (1 of each color initially), and perishables (raw meat, yeast decay over turns) are
managed via a simple inventory UI.
-
**Enabler Mechanics:** Possessions act as "keys"
—e.g., holding a pickaxe unlocks mining
choices globally, but durability wears (recharge at sleeping quarters for $2). Always-enabled
choices encourage risk/reward without items.
-
**Progression:** Completing challenges unlocks new areas (e.g., mine shaft leads to
deeper caves with rare rocks). Failed/risky choices (like ignoring) build "fatigue" debuff,
reducing future choice efficiency by 20% until rested.
-
**Balancing:** Money is versatile but finite (earned via trades); rocks are specific (red
jasper for trades, blue for crafting). Possessions synergize—e.g., foreman + day shift halves
labor costs across challenges.
-
**Replayability:** Randomize elements (e.g., ship encounter might need yellow jasper
instead). Priest/fighter example ties in: Role-based possessions (prayers vs. sword) alter
choice pools—e.g., priest gets "bless debris" for free clearance.
