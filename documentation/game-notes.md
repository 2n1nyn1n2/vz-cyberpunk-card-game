# cyberpunk

You are in a mining rig, trying to mine your way out of the moon. 

Others have tried before and got stuck.
If you find an empty tunnel, you can follow it until you find the stuck ship.
If you help the ship, or fight the ship, you can get minerals from it.

If you mine through the rock, you can discover new minerals.

# starting

Your starting choice is mine the red, green, or blue rock.

Once you mine enough of the colored rock, you chose to go to redder, greener, or bluer rock.
