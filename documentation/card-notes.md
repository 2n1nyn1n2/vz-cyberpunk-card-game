# card and scene notes.

The goal of the game is to win. The way to win is to raise a child to 18 years of age without running out of money.

There are 19 scenes. Each scene is one year of the child's life.
The chapter zero (the prelude) is the pregnancy, so 18 scenes, with 1 year of pregnancy (rounded up) and 18 years of life.

In each scene there is 1 major challenge, 2 medium challenges, and 4 common challenges.
When you survive each challenge, you get money, and a choice of 1 of 3 benefits.

To beat the challenge, you use your benefits. By default, you start with 10 benefits and draw 5 of them.
Benefits have a cost (money), and a status update (increments or decrements a status)

This ddocument outlines the scenes, challenges, and benefits.
